## Checkout

Assume we have an application for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items. Items each have their own price, which can change frequently. There are also weekly special offers for when multiple items are bought. An example of this would be “Apples are 50 each or 3 for 130”.

This week's rule:


| item   |Price for 1 item | Offer                |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Apple  | 1 €             | 3 for the price of 2 |
| Banana | 2 €             | 6 for the price of 3 |
| Peach  | 3 €             |  -                   |
